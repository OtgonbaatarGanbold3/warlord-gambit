## **DETAILED GAME MECHANICS**

### **TACTICAL COMBAT:**

**Board:**

- 10×10 grid (640×640 pixels, 64px tiles)
- Terrain types affect combat:
    - Plains: Neutral
    - Forest: +5 DEF, provides cover from ranged
    - Mountain: +3 DEF, +1 range for archers, costs 2 movement
    - Water: -2 DEF, costs 2 movement
    - Lava: 5 damage per turn

**Unit Stats:**

- HP (Hit Points): 30-120
- ATK (Attack): 10-30
- DEF (Defense): 5-20
- SPD (Speed): 5-12 (determines turn order)
- Movement Range: 1-2 tiles
- Attack Range: 1-3 tiles

**Combat Formula:**

gdscript

`base_damage = attacker.ATK - defender.DEF
terrain_atk_bonus = attacker's terrain.attack_bonus
terrain_def_bonus = defender's terrain.defense_bonus
modified_damage = max(1, base_damage + terrain_atk_bonus - terrain_def_bonus)

# 10% crit chance (2× damage)
if randf() < 0.1:
    final_damage = modified_damage * 2
else:
    final_damage = modified_damage
```

**Turn System:**
- Player turn → Enemy turn → Repeat
- Player controls all units during their turn
- Enemy AI acts during enemy turn
- Each unit can move once and attack once per turn
- Press Enter or click "End Turn" to switch

**Movement Rules:**
- Hero: 2 tiles in any direction (king-like)
- Elite Warrior: 2 tiles orthogonally or diagonally
- Elite Archer: 2 tiles movement, 3 tile attack range
- Pawn: 1 tile forward, diagonal to attack

**Win Conditions:**
- Eliminate all enemy units
- OR defeat enemy Hero unit
- (Boss battles may have special objectives)

---

### **ARMY MANAGEMENT:**

**Squad System (Banner Saga-inspired):**

**Army Structure:**
```
TOTAL ARMY (grows to 20-30 units)
├─ Active Squad (8 units) ← Deployed in battles
├─ Reserve (unlimited) ← Backup units
└─ Wounded (recovering) ← Unavailable for 1-2 battles
```

**Deployment:**
- Before each battle: Choose which 8 units to deploy
- Can swap units from Reserve into Active Squad
- Wounded units cannot be deployed
- Auto-deploy option available (AI picks best 8)

**Army Growth:**
```
Run Start: 5 units (1 Hero, 2 Elite, 2 Pawns)
Region 1 End: 10-12 units
Region 2 End: 18-20 units
Region 3 End: 25-30 units`

**Wounded System:**

- Unit reaches 0 HP → Wounded (not dead)
- Wounded units unavailable for 1-2 battles
- Can pay gold at shops to heal immediately
- Auto-heal after completing a region

**Why This Works:**

- Battles stay 8v8 or smaller (manageable)
- Army size still matters (provides options and reserves)
- Wounded system creates tension (can't use same squad every battle)
- Encourages unit diversity

### **ITEM & EQUIPMENT SYSTEM:**

**Equipment Slots per Unit:**

- Weapon (1 slot)
- Armor (1 slot)
- Accessory (1 slot)

**Item Rarities:**

- Common (60% drop rate): +5 HP, +3 ATK, +2 DEF
- Uncommon (25% drop rate): +10 HP, +5 ATK, special effects
- Rare (12% drop rate): +15 HP, +10 ATK, powerful effects
- Legendary (3% drop rate): +20+ stats, game-changing effects

**Example Items:**

- Iron Sword (Common Weapon): +5 ATK
- Steel Shield (Common Armor): +5 DEF
- Boots of Speed (Common Accessory): +3 SPD
- Health Amulet (Uncommon): +20 HP, "Regenerate 2 HP/turn"
- Flame Sword (Rare): +12 ATK, "10% burn enemy"
- Dragon Scale Armor (Legendary): +30 HP, +15 DEF, "Immune to fire"

**Item Application:**

gdscript

`# When item equipped:
unit.max_hp += item.hp_bonus
unit.current_hp += item.hp_bonus
unit.current_atk += item.atk_bonus
unit.current_def += item.def_bonus
unit.current_speed += item.speed_bonus
unit.update_visuals()`

**Item Sources:**

- Battle rewards (choose item card)
- Shop purchases (50-300 gold)
- Event rewards
- Boss drops (guaranteed Rare/Legendary)

---

### **FORMATION SYSTEM:**

**Formations provide passive bonuses to all units:**

**Available Formations:**

- **Phalanx** (Roman specialty): +5 DEF when adjacent to ally
- **Wedge** (Barbarian specialty): +5 ATK when in V-shape
- **Scattered** (Desert specialty): +3 SPD when no adjacent allies
- **Shield Wall** (Dwarf specialty): +10 DEF in straight line

**Formation Selection:**

- Chosen at run start (before first battle)
- Cannot change mid-run
- Unlockable via meta-progression

**Formation Bonuses Applied:**

gdscript

`# In unit.initialize():
if unit_data.faction matches selected_formation.faction:
    unit.current_def += formation.def_bonus
    unit.current_atk += formation.atk_bonus
    # etc.
```

---

### **PROGRESSION SYSTEMS:**

### **ENEMY AI BEHAVIOR:**

**Current AI (Simple):**

gdscript

`for each enemy unit:
    find nearest player unit
    if in attack range:
        attack
    else:
        move toward target`

**Planned AI Improvements:**

- Archers stay back and shoot (don't rush forward)
- Warriors protect archers (formation awareness)
- Injured units retreat toward allies
- Use terrain tactically (move to forests for cover, mountains for range)
- Boss AI: Phase-based behavior changes

**Difficulty Scaling:**

gdscript

`enemy_stats = base_stats × region_multiplier × army_power_factor

army_power_factor = 0.8 + (player_army_size / 40) × 0.4
# If player has 10 units: factor = 1.0 (baseline)
# If player has 30 units: factor = 1.2 (+20% enemy stats)
```

---

### **ECONOMY SYSTEM:**

**Gold Sources:**
- Gold reward cards (instead of unit/item): 100-300g

Total per successful run: ~2000-3000 gold`

**Spending Strategy:**

- Early: Buy units to grow army
- Mid: Buy items for key units
- Late: Healing + premium items

---

### **EVENT SYSTEM (Data-Driven):**

**Event Structure (EventData resource):**

gdscript

`extends Resource
class_name EventData

@export var event_id: String
@export var event_name: String

@export var choices: Array[EventChoice]

# EventChoice sub-resource:
# - choice_text: String
# - outcomes: Array[Outcome]
#   - outcome_type: (GAIN_UNIT, GAIN_ITEM, MODIFY_GOLD, ADD_BUFF, START_BATTLE, etc.)

```

**Example Event:**
```
Event: "The Deserter"
Description: "A wounded enemy soldier begs to join your army."
