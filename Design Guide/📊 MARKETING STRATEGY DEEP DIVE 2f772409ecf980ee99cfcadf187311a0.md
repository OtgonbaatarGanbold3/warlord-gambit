# 📊 MARKETING STRATEGY DEEP DIVE

## **Devlog Format (Optimized for Growth):**

### **YouTube Devlogs (Every 2 weeks):**

**Structure (8-12 minutes):**

`0:00-0:30 - Hook (show coolest new thing)
0:30-1:00 - Recap what you did last 2 weeks
1:00-6:00 - Deep dive (show process, code, art)
6:00-8:00 - Show results (gameplay with new features)
8:00-9:00 - Challenges faced (be honest!)
9:00-10:00 - What's next + call to action (wishlist!)
10:00-12:00 - Bonus (bloopers, time-lapses)`

**Editing style:**

- Fast-paced (no dead air)
- Captions/text on screen
- Background music (your own!)
- B-roll of you coding/drawing

**Title format:**

- "Making a Tactical Roguelike #5 | Custom Faction Art"
- "Solo Dev Devlog #8 | Adding JUICE to Combat"

---

### **Twitter Strategy:**

**Post frequency: 3-4× per week**

**Content types:**

- 🎨 Art WIP (sketches → final sprites)
- 🎮 Gameplay GIFs (15 seconds, satisfying moments)
- 💭 Dev thoughts ("Spent 3 hours on this particle effect, worth it!")
- 📊 Poll community ("Which faction should I add next?")
- 🔄 Retweet other indie devs (community building)

**Hashtags:**

- #indiedev #gamedev #indiegame
- #roguelike #tactics #turnbased
- #screenshotsaturday (Saturdays!)
- #wipwednesday (Wednesdays!)

**Engagement:**

- Reply to every comment
- Follow other tactical/roguelike devs
- Share other people's work
- Be authentic (not just self-promotion)

---

### **Reddit Strategy:**

**Subreddits to post in:**

- r/IndieGaming (weekly updates)
- r/roguelikes (when showing roguelike features)
- r/gamedev (asking for feedback)
- r/godot (showing Godot-specific tech)
- r/PixelArt (if you do pixel art sprites)

**Post types:**

- "I've been working on [X] for 6 months, here's my progress"
- "Implemented [cool feature], here's how it works"
- "Indie dev here, what do you think of this mechanic?"

**Golden rule:** Give before you take

- Comment on 10 other posts before posting yours
- Provide value (help others)
- Don't just spam "wishlist my game"
